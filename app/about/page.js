            Where nature`s beauty and comfortable living blend seamlessly.
            Hidden away in the heart of the Italian Dolomites, this is your
            paradise away from home. But it`s not just about the luxury cabins.
            It`s about the experience of reconnecting with nature and enjoying
            simple pleasures with family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our {cabins.length} luxury cabins provide a cozy base, but the real
            freedom and peace you`ll find in the surrounding mountains. Wander
            through lush forests, breathe in the fresh air, and watch the stars
            twinkle above from the warmth of a campfire or your hot tub.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where memorable moments are made, surrounded by
            nature&apos;s splendor. It`s a place to slow down, relax, and feel
            the joy of being together in a beautiful setting.
